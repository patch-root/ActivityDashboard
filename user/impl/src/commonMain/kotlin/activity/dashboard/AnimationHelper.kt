 * Helper class to determine whether animations are enabled. This helps with flaky UI tests.

 * The interesting part is that this interface is part of the `:impl` module, because it doesn't
 * need to be shared with other modules. The implementations live in the platform specific folders
 * like `androidMain`. kotlin-inject-anvil will use the right implementation on each platform
 * automatically.
